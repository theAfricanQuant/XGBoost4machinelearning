    "In classification, our challenge is tackling the problem of identifying which of a set of categories (sub-populations) an observation (or observations) belongs to. For example, a child asked to separate collection of items on a beach into stones, sea shells and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this ability, we could make use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class labels to our emails so they could help us sort our emails into two categories: \"spam\" and \"not spam\" \n",

    "There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each.\n",

    "**Logistic regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is the most fundamental classification algorithm. Mathematically, logistic regression works in a manner similar to linear regression. For each column, logistic regression finds an appropriate weight, or coefficient, that maximizes model accuracy. The primary difference is that instead of summing each term, as in linear regression, logistic regression uses the sigmoid function. Here all values greater than a certain threshold (say 0.5) are matched to 1 (or true, meaning the person earns an income greater than $\\$50,000$) and all values less than the threshold are matched to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between implementing logistic regression and linear regression with scikit-learn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The feature matrix or X should fit into categories; and,\n",
    "2. The error should be in terms of accuracy, which is already by default."
