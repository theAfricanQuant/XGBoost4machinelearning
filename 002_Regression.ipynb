    "# Introduction\n",

    "Regression analysis is a statistical process that helps us understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The dependent variable is the thing we want to predict or understand better, and the independent variables are the things that we think might be related to the dependent variable. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house based on some of its features like size, location, number of bedrooms etc. We can employ a regression analysis to understand how these features of a particular house affects its price. In this case, the dependent variable is the price of the house, and the independent variables are the features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is always explained mathematically because it helps us understand how strong or weak the relationship is. We use mathematical formulas to find the best possible mapping between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This mapping can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for new values of the independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms aim to predict the values of one output column, (called the target vector and denoted by small $y$), using data from one or more input columns (or the feature matrix, denoted with capital $X$). The predictions rely on mathematical equations determined by the general class of machine learning problems being addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common regression algorithm is linear regression. Linear regression takes each column that makes up the feature matrix as a polynomial variable and multiplies the values by coefficients (also called weights) to predict the target column. Gradient descent works under the hood to minimize the error. The predictions of linear regression could be any real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bike rentals dataset we worked on in the last section, `'cnt'` is the number of bike rentals in a given day. Predicting this column would be of great use to a bike rental company. We will denote this as our target vector $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission (should we accept) would be to predict the correct number of bike rentals on a given day based on data such as whether this day is a holiday or working day, forecasted temperature, humidity, windspeed, and so on (our feature matrix $X$).\n",

What this does is to split the data multiple times into different training sets and test sets, and then to take the mean of the scores. The number of splits, called folds, is denoted by $k$. It's standard to use k = 3, 4, 5, or 10 splits.\n",
